# Budget-App
https://trackbudgetapp.netlify.app/

Budget App is a application that is meant to be used for budget tracking. In this project, I've used array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort, push, forEach), number methods (Math.abs(), Math.floor(),Math.random(), toFixed()) as well as callback functions and objects. Values inserted in input fields are dynamically taken, calculated and displayed on UI. Also, I've used localStorage to keep data saved across browser sessions.

Date of production: May 2021
